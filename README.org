*  Leetcode CMake
** Requirements
- CMake (gtest is included in =src=)
- GCC/Clang
** Usage
- create cpp files in src/, e.g., =0001-two-sums.cpp= (or *py* file in =src/script-py=)
- =chmod +x run.sh= (in zsh) (=build= will created automatically and =cmake= will run in =/build/=)
- [[run.sh]]: run =./run.sh problem-number= or =sh run.sh problem-number= in parent directory (e.g., =./run.sh 0001= , 0001 is the number of problem)
- *python* script can be tested in the command line, i.e., =python src/script-py/0001-two-sums.py=
- *julia* script can be tested in the command line, i.e., =julia src/srcript-jl/0006-zigzag-conversion.jl=
