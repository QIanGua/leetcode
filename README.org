*  Leetcode CMake
** Requirements
- CMake
- GTest
- GCC/Clang
** Usage
- create */build/* in parent directory through *mkdir build*
- create cpp files in src/, e.g., *0001-two-sums.cpp* (or py file in src/Python temporally)
- *chmod +x run.sh* (in zsh)
- run *./run.sh 0001* in parent directory (0001 is the number of problem)
